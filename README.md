# WeatherApp

STEPS:
Go to openweathermap website and make an account. Create your own API Key (generates for you) and then plug this into the WeatherApp class under this._key.
Copy and paste the path of index.html and enjoy!_

The WeatherApp is my attempt to learn how to webscrape better through javascript. I used the openweathermap API to gather data from off the web and then I was able to get the current weather, display the name of the city, show weather icons to express the weather type, and even show a four day future and past forcast. All of which are accessible in fahrenheit or celcius!
